# Templates for machine learning projects

This is a set of templates for machine learning projects. 
Some are optimized for kaggle style competitions others are more generic
for working with tidymodels. This is a work in progress, and def. not a final or best version. 


- [] template for cross validating a model
- [x] generic data exploration
- [] set of algorithms for regression type problems (lm, splines , lightgbm, catboost)
- [] set of algorithms for classifications type problems (glm logistic, svm, lightgbm, catboost)

Maybe break stuff up so I can call them seperately, or in functions.
Or just use boilerplate package https://github.com/tidymodels/usemodels. 

Small functions for creating folder structure?
