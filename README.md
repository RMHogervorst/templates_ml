# Templates for machine learning projects

This is a set of templates for machine learning projects. 
Some are optimized for kaggle style competitions others are more generic
for working with tidymodels.


- [] template for cross validating a model
- [] generic data exploration
- [] set of algorithms for regression type problems (lm, splines , lightgbm, catboost)
- [] set of algorithms for classifications type problems (glm logistic, svm, lightgbm, catboost)
